Overview
This project is a USB to UART bridge designed using the CH340K USB to Serial chip. It allows for easy communication between a computer and a microcontroller through a Type-C USB connector. 
Ideal for programming or debugging microcontrollers like ESP32, STM32, etc.

This USB to UART PCB was designed by carefully following Ampnicsâ€™ video and analyzing each functional block. While the current routing can be optimized further, 
The design serves its purpose effectively. Future revisions will focus on refining the layout, improving signal integrity, and enhancing grounding practices.
